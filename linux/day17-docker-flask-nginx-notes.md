# Day 17 – Dockerized Application with Nginx (DevOps Perspective)

## Objective
To design and deploy a containerized Flask application using Docker and expose it
via Nginx reverse proxy, simulating a real production-like setup.

## Key Responsibilities (DevOps Role)
- Containerizing application using Docker
- Managing multi-container setup via Docker Compose
- Implementing Nginx as reverse proxy
- Maintaining clean Linux directory structure
- Version control using Git & GitHub

## Components Explanation
- Flask App: Backend service running inside Docker container
- Dockerfile: Defines application image build steps
- Docker Compose: Manages multiple services
- Nginx: Handles incoming traffic and forwards to backend

## Why This Matters in Production
- Reverse proxy improves security
- Containers ensure consistency
- Easy scaling and deployment
- Clear separation of concerns

## Outcome
Successfully deployed a multi-container application following DevOps best practices.
